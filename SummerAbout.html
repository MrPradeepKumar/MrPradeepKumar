                <p id="paragraph">Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons,
                    occurring after spring and before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice,
                     the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and
                      dark hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after
                       the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate,
                        tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere,
                         it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.

            <p class="lower_text">The concept of summer in European languages is associated with growth
                and maturity, especially that of cultivated plants, and indeed summer is the season of
                greatest plant growth in regions with sufficient summer rainfall. Festivals and rites 
                have been used in many cultures to celebrate summer in recognition of its importance in
                food production.
