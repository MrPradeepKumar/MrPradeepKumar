                    Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates.
                    It occurs after autumn and before spring.
                    The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere
                    is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates 
                    as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.

                When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in
                 the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, 
                 winter brings snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter 
                 solstice is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or 
                 South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its 
                 farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on which 
                 this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length 
                 increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
