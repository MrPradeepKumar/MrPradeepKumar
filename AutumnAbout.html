                <p id="paragraph">Autumn, also known as fall in American English,
                    [1] is one of the four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics,
                    autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September
                    (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere).
                    Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes
                    noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. 
                    Day length decreases and night length increases as the season
                    progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere)
                    and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate 
                    climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous 
                    trees as they prepare to shed.

                The concept of autumn in European languages is connected with the harvesting of crops;
                in many cultures autumn, like the other seasons, has been marked by rites and festivals
                revolving around the seasonâ€™s importance in food production. Animals gather food in
                autumn in preparation for the coming winter, and those with fur often grow thicker
                coats. Many birds migrate toward the Equator to escape the falling temperatures.
                A common autumn phenomenon in the central and eastern United States and in Europe
                is Indian summer, a period of unseasonably warm weather that sometimes occurs in
                late October or November.
